# Conductor Implement

## Cursor Tool Mapping

- **AskQuestion** for structured user prompts (replaces Gemini `ask_user`)
- **Write** / **StrReplace** for file operations (replaces `write_file` / `replace`)
- **Shell** for shell commands (replaces `run_shell_command`)
- Use relative paths under `conductor/` for all Conductor artifacts

## Output Style

Follow **Agent Output Style** in the Conductor rule — **i-have-adhd** skill for base rules; `templates/output-style.md` for `/conductor-implement` format.

**Implement-specific:** Each progress message = (1) what now works, (2) task N/M + track name, (3) next todo. On errors: file:line, cause, fix. On track complete: lead with shipped outcome, then §5.0 cleanup `AskQuestion` — include combined continue options when eligible next tracks exist (user must choose; never auto-advance).

## Plugin Template Path

Locate installed plugin templates in this order:
1. `~/.cursor/plugins/local/conductor/templates/`
2. Search `~/.cursor/plugins/cache/` for the conductor plugin `templates/` directory
3. Fallback (marketplace dev): `./plugins/conductor/templates/` from repo root

## Cursor Plan Format

When creating or updating implementation plans, write to `conductor/plans/<slug>_<shortid>.plan.md` with this frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: Track Title
overview: One-paragraph summary derived from spec
todos:
  - id: kebab-case-id
    content: "Task description"
    status: pending
isProject: true
---
```

- `status` values: `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`
- On task completion, set `status: completed` and append commit SHA to `content`
- Markdown body below frontmatter carries phases, goals, architecture
- Register plan path in `conductor/context/tracks.md`

## Tracks Registry Format

Use this format in `conductor/context/tracks.md`:

```markdown
- [ ] **Track: Description**
  *Spec: [../specs/<track_id>/spec.md](../specs/<track_id>/spec.md)*
  *Plan: [../plans/<slug>_<shortid>.plan.md](../plans/<slug>_<shortid>.plan.md)*
```

Status markers: `[ ]` pending, `[~]` in progress, `[x]` complete.

## Todo Status Workflow

When executing tasks, update the plan file frontmatter:
1. Set `todos[].status` to `in_progress` before starting a task
2. Set `todos[].status` to `completed` and append ` (<sha>)` to `content` after commit
3. Follow `conductor/context/workflow.md` for TDD, git notes, and phase checkpoints


## 1.0 SYSTEM DIRECTIVE
You are an AI agent assistant for the Conductor spec-driven development framework. Your current task is to implement a track. You MUST follow this protocol precisely.

CRITICAL: You must validate the success of every tool call. If any tool call fails, you MUST halt the current operation immediately, announce the failure to the user, and await further instructions.

---

## 1.1 SETUP CHECK
**PROTOCOL: Verify that the Conductor environment is properly set up.**

1.  **Verify Core Context:** Using the **Universal File Resolution Protocol**, resolve and verify the existence of:
    -   **Product Definition**
    -   **Tech Stack**
    -   **Workflow**

2.  **Handle Failure:** If ANY of these are missing (or their resolved paths do not exist), Announce: "Conductor is not set up. Please run `/conductor-setup`." and HALT.


---

## 2.0 TRACK SELECTION
**PROTOCOL: Identify and select the track to be implemented.**

1.  **Check for User Input:** First, check if the user provided a track name as an argument (e.g., `/conductor-implement <track_description>`).

2.  **Locate and Parse Tracks Registry:**
    -   Resolve the **Tracks Registry**.
    -   Read and parse this file. You must parse the file by splitting its content by the `---` separator to identify each track section. For each section, extract the status (`[ ]`, `[~]`, `[x]`), the track description (from the `##` heading), and the link to the track folder.
    -   **CRITICAL:** If no track sections are found after parsing, announce: "The tracks file is empty or malformed. No tracks to implement." and halt.

3.  **Continue:** Immediately proceed to the next step to select a track.

4.  **Select Track (Eligible Tracks Protocol):**
    -   **If a track name was provided:**
        1.  Perform an exact, case-insensitive match for the provided name against the track descriptions you parsed.
        2.  Resolve `<track_id>` and read `metadata.json`. If any `depends_on` track is not `[x]`, announce: "Track '<track_description>' is blocked. Complete `<missing_track_id>` first." Then call `AskQuestion` to pick from **eligible** tracks (see below) or halt.
        3.  If a unique match is found and not blocked, immediately call the `AskQuestion` tool to confirm the selection (do not repeat the question in the chat):
            - **questions:**
                - **header:** "Confirm"
                - **question:** "I found track '<track_description>'. Is this correct?"
                - **type:** "yesno"
        4.  If no match is found, or if the match is ambiguous, immediately call the `AskQuestion` tool to inform the user and request the correct track name (do not repeat the question in the chat):
            - **questions:**
                - **header:** "Clarify"
                - **question:** "I couldn't find a unique track matching the name you provided. Did you mean '<next_available_track>'? Or please type the exact track name."
                - **type:** "text"
    -   **If no track name was provided (or if the previous step failed):**
        1.  **Compute eligible tracks** per **Eligible Tracks Protocol** in the Conductor rule.
        2.  **If no incomplete tracks:** Announce: "No incomplete tracks found. All tasks are completed!" and halt.
        3.  **If incomplete tracks exist but none are eligible:** Announce: "All incomplete tracks are blocked. Complete `<track_id>` first (see sequencing table in tracks.md)." and halt.
        4.  **If exactly one eligible track:** Call `AskQuestion`:
            - **questions:**
                - **header:** "Next Track"
                - **question:** "Next eligible track: '<track_description>'. Proceed?"
                - **type:** "yesno"
            - If declined, call `AskQuestion` `text` for exact track name.
        5.  **If multiple eligible tracks:** Call `AskQuestion` `choice` — one option per eligible track (label = track description; note **Parallel-ready** in description when sharing lowest `order`). Include option **Stop for now**. Put lowest-`order` track first (Recommended).
            - If user picks a track, proceed. If **Stop for now**, halt.

5.  **Handle No Selection:** If no track is selected, inform the user and await further instructions.

---

## 3.0 TRACK IMPLEMENTATION
**PROTOCOL: Execute the selected track.**

1.  **Announce Action:** One line: track name + first todo you are starting (no "I will now..." preamble).

2.  **Load Track Context:**
    a. **Identify Track Folder:** From the tracks file, identify the track's folder link to get the `<track_id>`.
    b. **Read Files:**
        -   **Track Context:** Using the **Universal File Resolution Protocol**, resolve and read the **Specification** and **Cursor plan file** for the selected track.
        -   **Workflow:** Resolve **Workflow** (via the **Universal File Resolution Protocol** using the project's index file).
    c. **Error Handling:** If you fail to read any of these files, you MUST stop and inform the user of the error.

3.  **Legacy Sync Fallback (only when the plan has no `conductor-sync-in-progress` todo):**
    -   Update **Tracks Registry** `- [ ]` → `- [~]`.
    -   Update `conductor/specs/<track_id>/metadata.json`: `status: in_progress`, refresh `updated_at`.
    -   If the plan already includes `conductor-sync-in-progress`, **skip this step** — the task loop owns sync.
    -   After this step, run **Git Isolation** per §3.0 step 4d before the task loop continues.

4.  **Execute Tasks and Update Track Plan:**
    a. **Announce:** One line: executing plan todos per **Workflow** (task index when known).
    b. **Iterate Through Tasks:** Loop each todo in frontmatter order. Track whether **Git Isolation** has run for the **current track** (`git_isolation_done`).
    c. **For Each Task:**
        i. **`conductor-sync-in-progress`:** Update registry `[~]`, metadata `in_progress`, refresh `updated_at`. Mark todo `completed`. Follow **Git Write Policy** for any commit. Then run **Git Isolation** per step d if not yet done.
        ii. **`conductor-sync-complete`:** For decision tracks (`track_role: decision` in metadata), verify no `spike/*` branch exists (`git branch --list 'spike/*'`). If spike branch exists, halt — run `/conductor-prototype` delete step first. Update registry `[x]`, metadata `completed`, refresh `updated_at`. Mark todo `completed`. Follow **Git Write Policy** to commit Conductor files.
        iii. **All other todos:** Before the first implementation todo, if sync-in-progress is satisfied (registry `[~]`) and **Git Isolation** has not run, execute step d. Then follow the **Workflow** task lifecycle.
           - **CRITICAL:** Human-in-the-loop steps in the **Workflow** MUST use `AskQuestion`.
           - **On test failure:** Follow the **Systematic Debugging Protocol** in the **Workflow**.
    d. **Git Isolation (once per track):** After sync-in-progress is satisfied and **before** any implementation todo or other Git write, follow the **Git Isolation Protocol** in the Conductor rule. Set `git_isolation_done` after completing. Reset `git_isolation_done = false` when starting a new track via §5.0 continue options. Also run after step 3 legacy sync if the plan has no sync-in-progress todo.

5.  **Legacy Finalize Fallback (only when the plan has no `conductor-sync-complete` todo, or it remains pending after the loop):**
    -   Update **Tracks Registry** `[~]` → `[x]` and metadata `completed` if not already done.
    -   Follow **Git Write Policy** to commit Conductor files.
    -   Announce track completion.
    -   If the loop completed `conductor-sync-complete`, **skip this step**.

## 4.0 SYNCHRONIZE PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
**PROTOCOL: Update project-level documentation based on the completed track.**

1.  **Execution Trigger:** This protocol MUST only be executed when a track has reached a `[x]` status in the tracks file. DO NOT execute this protocol for any other track status changes.

2.  **Announce Synchronization:** Announce that you are now synchronizing the project-level documentation with the completed track's specifications.

3.  **Load Track Specification:** Read the track's **Specification**.

4.  **Load Project Documents:**
    -   Resolve and read:
        -   **Product Definition**
        -   **Tech Stack**
        -   **Product Guidelines**

5.  **Analyze and Update:**
    a.  **Analyze Specification:** Carefully analyze the **Specification** to identify any new features, changes in functionality, or updates to the technology stack.
    b.  **Update Product Definition:**
        i. **Condition for Update:** Based on your analysis, you MUST determine if the completed feature or bug fix significantly impacts the description of the product itself.
        ii. **Propose and Confirm Changes:** If an update is needed:
            -   **Ask for Approval:** Use the `AskQuestion` tool to request confirmation. You MUST embed the proposed updates (in a diff format) directly into the `question` field so the user can review them in context.
                - **questions:**
                    - **header:** "Product"
                    - **question:**
                        Please review the proposed updates to the Product Definition below. Do you approve?

                        ---

                        <Insert Proposed product.md Updates/Diff Here>
                    - **type:** "yesno"
        iii. **Action:** Only after receiving explicit user confirmation, perform the file edits to update the **Product Definition** file. Keep a record of whether this file was changed.
    c.  **Update Tech Stack:**
        i. **Condition for Update:** Similarly, you MUST determine if significant changes in the technology stack are detected as a result of the completed track.
        ii. **Propose and Confirm Changes:** If an update is needed:
            -   **Ask for Approval:** Use the `AskQuestion` tool to request confirmation. You MUST embed the proposed updates (in a diff format) directly into the `question` field so the user can review them in context.
                - **questions:**
                    - **header:** "Tech Stack"
                    - **question:**
                        Please review the proposed updates to the Tech Stack below. Do you approve?

                        ---

                        <Insert Proposed tech-stack.md Updates/Diff Here>
                    - **type:** "yesno"
        iii. **Action:** Only after receiving explicit user confirmation, perform the file edits to update the **Tech Stack** file. Keep a record of whether this file was changed.
    d. **Update Product Guidelines (Strictly Controlled):**
        i. **CRITICAL WARNING:** This file defines the core identity and communication style of the product. It should be modified with extreme caution and ONLY in cases of significant strategic shifts, such as a product rebrand or a fundamental change in user engagement philosophy. Routine feature updates or bug fixes should NOT trigger changes to this file.
        ii. **Condition for Update:** You may ONLY propose an update to this file if the track's **Specification** explicitly describes a change that directly impacts branding, voice, tone, or other core product guidelines.
        iii. **Propose and Confirm Changes:** If the conditions are met:
            -   **Ask for Approval:** Use the `AskQuestion` tool to request confirmation. You MUST embed the proposed changes (in a diff format) directly into the `question` field, including a clear warning.
                - **questions:**
                    - **header:** "Product"
                    - **question:**
                        WARNING: This is a sensitive action as it impacts core product guidelines. Please review the proposed changes below. Do you approve these critical changes?

                        ---

                        <Insert Proposed product-guidelines.md Updates/Diff Here>
                    - **type:** "yesno"
        iv. **Action:** Only after receiving explicit user confirmation, perform the file edits. Keep a record of whether this file was changed.

6.  **Final Report:** One line per changed file (max 5). If none changed: "No doc updates needed." If any file changed, follow **Git Write Policy** before commit (`docs(conductor): Synchronize docs for track '<track_description>'`).
    - **Example (Product Definition changed):**
        > "Docs synced. **Product Definition** updated for the new feature. **Tech Stack** and **Product Guidelines** unchanged."
    - **Example (no changes):**
        > "Docs synced. No project doc updates needed for this track."

## 5.0 TRACK CLEANUP
**PROTOCOL: Offer cleanup and optional continue to the next eligible track in one confirmed choice.**

1.  **Execution Trigger:** This protocol MUST only be executed after the current track has been successfully implemented and the `SYNCHRONIZE PROJECT DOCUMENTATION` step is complete.

2.  **Compute next tracks:** Apply **Eligible Tracks Protocol** in the Conductor rule **before** prompting. Record eligible `<track_id>` + description list; note **parallel-ready** (∥) when multiple share lowest `order`.

3.  **Ask for User Choice:** Build options dynamically, then call `AskQuestion` (do not repeat in chat):

    **Always include:**
    - **Review** — Run `/conductor-review` before finalizing.
    - **Archive** — Move track folder to `conductor/archive/`, remove from tracks file.
    - **Delete** — Permanently delete track folder and registry entry.
    - **Skip** — Leave completed track in tracks file; stop for now.

    **When eligible next tracks exist**, append combined options (user must explicitly choose — never auto-continue):
    - For each eligible track (cap at **2** in this prompt; if more than 2 eligible, include only the two lowest-`order` tracks here):
        - Label: `Skip and continue to <track_id>`, Description: `<track_description>` + `(∥)` when parallel-ready. Leave completed track in registry; start implementing next track.
        - Label: `Archive and continue to <track_id>`, Description: Archive completed track, then implement `<track_description>`.
    - If **>2 eligible** tracks, also add:
        - Label: `Choose next track…`, Description: Pick among all eligible tracks (follow-up `AskQuestion`).

    Put the **recommended** next track (lowest `order`) first among continue options.

    - **questions:**
        - **header:** "Track Cleanup"
        - **question:** "Track '<track_description>' is complete. What would you like to do?" + if eligible exist: append one line listing eligible ids.
        - **type:** "choice"
        - **multiSelect:** false

4.  **Handle User Response:**

    *   **Review:** Announce: "Run `/conductor-review` to verify changes. You can archive or continue afterward." Halt.

    *   **Archive** (standalone): Execute archive steps (4a), commit, announce success. Halt.

    *   **Delete** (standalone): Confirm via `AskQuestion` `yesno`, then delete steps (4b). Halt unless cancelled.

    *   **Skip** (standalone): Announce completed track remains in tracks file. Halt.

    *   **Skip and continue to `<track_id>`:** Announce leaving completed track in registry. Go to **§5.1 Continue** with that `<track_id>`.

    *   **Archive and continue to `<track_id>`:** Execute archive steps (4a), commit, announce archived. Go to **§5.1 Continue** with that `<track_id>`.

    *   **Choose next track…:** Call `AskQuestion` `choice` — one option per eligible track + **Stop for now**. On track pick → if user also wants archive first, call `AskQuestion` `yesno`: "Archive '<completed_track>' before continuing?" — on yes run 4a then §5.1; on no §5.1. On stop → halt.

    **4a. Archive steps:**
    i. Create `conductor/archive/` if missing.
    ii. Move `<Specs Directory>/<track_id>` → `conductor/archive/<track_id>`.
    iii. Remove completed track section from **Tracks Registry**.
    iv. Follow **Git Write Policy** — message: `chore(conductor): Archive track '<track_description>'`.

    **4b. Delete steps:** (after yes on confirm)
    a. Delete `<Specs Directory>/<track_id>`.
    b. Remove track section from **Tracks Registry**.
    c. Follow **Git Write Policy** — message: `chore(conductor): Delete track '<track_description>'`.

---

## 5.1 CONTINUE TO NEXT TRACK
**PROTOCOL: Jump to the next selected track after explicit user choice in §5.0.**

1.  Resolve `<track_id>` against **Tracks Registry** and metadata. If no longer eligible (race), recompute per **Eligible Tracks Protocol** and call `AskQuestion` to pick again or halt.

2.  Set `git_isolation_done = false`.

3.  Go to **§3.0 TRACK IMPLEMENTATION** for the selected track.

4.  **Loop:** After §3.0 → §4.0 → §5.0, user may again choose a combined continue option until no eligible tracks remain or they pick a standalone halt option.
