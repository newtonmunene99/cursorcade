# Conductor Status

## Cursor Tool Mapping

- **AskQuestion** for structured user prompts (replaces Gemini `ask_user`)
- **Write** / **StrReplace** for file operations (replaces `write_file` / `replace`)
- **Shell** for shell commands (replaces `run_shell_command`)
- Use relative paths under `conductor/` for all Conductor artifacts

## Output Style

Follow **Agent Output Style** in the Conductor rule — **i-have-adhd** skill for base rules; `templates/output-style.md` for status format.

**Status-specific:** Line 1 = next action (`/conductor-implement` or named track). Then max 6 bullets: in-progress track + task N/M, progress fraction, **Eligible** tracks (mark ∥ when parallel-ready), **Blocked** tracks with missing `depends_on` (omit if none), verdict (On track | Behind | Blocked).

Apply **Eligible Tracks Protocol** from the Conductor rule when any track has `depends_on` or `programme_id` in metadata.

## Plugin Template Path

Locate installed plugin templates in this order:
1. `~/.cursor/plugins/local/conductor/templates/`
2. Search `~/.cursor/plugins/cache/` for the conductor plugin `templates/` directory
3. Fallback (marketplace dev): `./plugins/conductor/templates/` from repo root

## Parsing Cursor Plans

Parse each track's plan file (`conductor/plans/*.plan.md`):
- Count todos by `status`: `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`
- Read markdown body for phase headings
- Only support the standard tracks registry format: `- [ ] **Track:`


## 1.0 SYSTEM DIRECTIVE
You are an AI agent. Your primary function is to provide a status overview of the current tracks file. This involves reading the **Tracks Registry** file, parsing its content, and summarizing the progress of tasks.

CRITICAL: You must validate the success of every tool call. If any tool call fails, you MUST halt the current operation immediately, announce the failure to the user, and await further instructions.

## 1.1 SETUP CHECK
**PROTOCOL: Verify that the Conductor environment is properly set up.**

1.  **Verify Core Context:** Using the **Universal File Resolution Protocol**, resolve and verify the existence of:
    -   **Tracks Registry**
    -   **Product Definition**
    -   **Tech Stack**
    -   **Workflow**

2.  **Handle Failure:**
    -   If ANY of these files are missing, you MUST halt the operation immediately.
    -   Announce: "Conductor is not set up. Please run `/conductor-setup` to set up the environment."
    -   Do NOT proceed to Status Overview Protocol.

## 2.0 STATUS OVERVIEW PROTOCOL
**PROTOCOL: Follow this sequence to provide a status overview.**

### 2.1 Read Project Plan
1.  **Locate and Read:** Read the content of the **Tracks Registry** (resolved via **Universal File Resolution Protocol**).
2.  **Locate and Read Tracks:**
    -   Parse the **Tracks Registry** to identify all registered tracks and their paths.
        *   **Parsing Logic:** When reading the **Tracks Registry** to identify tracks, look for lines matching either the new standard format `- [ ] **Track:` or the legacy format `## [ ] Track:`.
    -   For each track, resolve and read its **Cursor plan file** (using **Universal File Resolution Protocol** via the track's index file).

### 2.2 Parse and Summarize Plan
1.  **Parse Content:**
    -   Identify major project phases/sections (e.g., top-level markdown headings).
    -   Identify individual tasks and their current status (e.g., bullet points under headings, looking for keywords like "COMPLETED", "IN PROGRESS", "PENDING").
2.  **Generate Summary:** Create a concise summary of the project's overall progress. This should include:
    -   The total number of major phases.
    -   The total number of tasks.
    -   The number of tasks completed, in progress, and pending.

### 2.3 Present Status Overview
1.  **Compute dependency state:** For programme tracks, apply **Eligible Tracks Protocol** in the Conductor rule. Identify **eligible**, **parallel-ready** (lowest shared `order`), and **blocked** tracks.
2.  **Output Summary:** Follow **Output Style** above. Required fields:
    -   **Next action:** `/conductor-implement` when eligible tracks exist; name the recommended track (lowest `order`). If none eligible, say which blocker to clear first.
    -   **In progress:** `[~]` track — task N/M (or "none")
    -   **Progress:** tasks_completed/tasks_total across active programme or all tracks (percentage)
    -   **Eligible:** comma-separated track ids/descriptions; append `(∥)` when multiple parallel-ready
    -   **Blocked:** `<track>` waits on `<depends_on>` — omit section if none
    -   **Verdict:** On track | Behind | Blocked (one word + optional reason)
    -   Include current timestamp on its own line after the next-action line
3.  **Programme table:** When `tracks.md` has a sequencing table, one line: "See sequencing table in tracks.md for order."
