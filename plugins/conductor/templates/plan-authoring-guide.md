# Conductor Plan Authoring Guide

Use this guide when generating Cursor plan files (`conductor/plans/*.plan.md`) during `/conductor-new-track`, `/conductor-setup`, or when revising an existing track plan.

Techniques adapted from [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) (MIT).

## Plan Header (markdown body)

Every plan body MUST start with:

```markdown
> **Conductor plan:** Runnable directly in Cursor or via `/conductor-implement`.
> Follow `conductor/context/workflow.md`, the Git Write Policy, and Agent Output Style in the Conductor rule.
```

Below the header, include:

- **Goal** — one sentence
- **Architecture** — 2–3 sentences
- **File structure map** — files to create/modify with one-line responsibility each

## Mandatory sync todos (frontmatter)

Every plan frontmatter MUST include these bookend todos (in addition to phase verification todos when the workflow defines them):

| Order | id | content (summary) |
| ----- | --- | ----------------- |
| **First** | `conductor-sync-in-progress` | Mark track `[~]` in `tracks.md`, set `metadata.json` `status` to `in_progress`, update `updated_at`. Git Write Policy applies. |
| **Last** | `conductor-sync-complete` | Mark track `[x]` in `tracks.md`, set `metadata.json` `status` to `completed`, update `updated_at`, commit Conductor files. Git Write Policy applies. |

**Do NOT inject** feature-branch, worktree, or other git-isolation todos by default. Git workflow is chosen at implementation start via the **Git Isolation Protocol** in the Conductor rule — unless the user explicitly asked to bake a git workflow into the plan during new-track planning.

### Example frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: Track Title
overview: One-paragraph summary derived from spec
depends_on: [owner_track_id]
blocks: [downstream_track_id]
programme_id: remediation_slug
todos:
  - id: conductor-sync-in-progress
    content: "Conductor — Mark track in progress (tracks.md [~], metadata.json in_progress)"
    status: pending
  - id: example-task
    content: "Write failing tests for example feature"
    status: pending
  - id: conductor-sync-complete
    content: "Conductor — Mark track complete (tracks.md [x], metadata.json completed)"
    status: pending
isProject: true
---
```

### Optional todo fields

Cursor UI may ignore unknown fields — they remain for agent protocol and programme review:

```yaml
- id: context-parity-impl
  content: "Implement context parity checks"
  status: pending
  phase: C4
  blocked_by: [metric-client-seam]
```

## Task right-sizing

Each frontmatter todo is the smallest unit that:

- Has its own test cycle (when workflow uses TDD)
- Produces an independently verifiable deliverable
- Aligns with the project's **Workflow** (e.g., separate "Write Tests" and "Implement" todos when TDD is required)

Fold setup, configuration, and scaffolding into the todo whose deliverable needs them. Split only where a reviewer could reject one task while approving its neighbor.

**Action-first todo text:** Start each `content` string with a verb ("Write failing tests for login", not "Login tests"). One deliverable per todo — no "and then" chains.

## Prerequisite todos

When a test todo assumes injectable fakes, clocks, or seams that production code does not yet expose:

- Prefix `content` with **`PREREQUISITE:`**
- Body must cite **why dependent tests are vacuous** (test output snippet or code path that bypasses fakes)
- Dependent todos list **`Blocked by:** `<prerequisite-id>`** in the plan body
- Programme synthesis pass auto-inserts prerequisites when duplicate or vacuous patterns are detected

Example:

```yaml
- id: metric-client-seam
  content: "PREREQUISITE: make attachClient honour ClientFromContext; repair vacuous TestRun_withFakeClient which hits real backend"
  status: pending
```

## Phased delivery

Tracks with **>12 todos** spanning independent subsystems MUST include a **phase map** in the plan body:

```markdown
## Phases
- **C1 lifecycle** — registry-freeze, env-freeze
- **C2 identity** — identity-validation, load-config
- **C3 validation** — numeric-validation
- **C4 parity** — context-parity, adk-validation ← lands after Track B
```

Label phase todos with optional `phase: C4` in frontmatter. Cross-track phase notes use `← lands after Track X`.

## Namespace authority

When a track owns synthetic IDs (`_prefix.*`), reserved prefixes, or a new package:

- Add plan body section **Namespace authority**
- One track owns constants + `IsReserved` / `IsFrameworkID` (or equivalent)
- Other tracks **import only** — no parallel rename/enforcement todos
- Programme synthesis assigns a single owner; non-owners get **Removed — owned by Track X** stubs

## Escape hatches for strict validation

When adding strict registration validation (reject empty slices, required fields, etc.):

- **Mandatory AskQuestion** before plan approval: "What opt-out API preserves existing capability?"
- Same track that adds the rule MUST implement the escape hatch (e.g. `NoSLOs()` sentinel)

## Test design constraints

Flag and fix plan todos that:

- Sleep >5s in tests (require injectable clocks)
- Require network I/O when the package already has slow integration tests
- Hit real external services when fakes exist but are bypassed

Require injectable clocks/fakes. Add optional **`no-network-tests-gate`** todo with acceptance: `go test -short` (or project equivalent) passes without external calls.

## Docs track dependencies

Documentation or troubleshooting tracks that key content on diagnostic IDs MUST:

- Declare `depends_on` the namespace-owner track in plan frontmatter
- Gate id-keyed todos until owner track completes (e.g. troubleshooting table waits for A+B id constants)

## Plan body detail (per task)

For each todo, the markdown body MUST include a section with:

- **Files:** `Create`, `Modify`, and `Test` paths (exact paths)
- **Interfaces:** what this task consumes from earlier tasks and what later tasks rely on (signatures, types, function names)
- **Micro-steps** (when workflow uses TDD), as a **numbered list** (one bounded action per step):
  1. Write failing test
  2. Run test — verify it fails for the expected reason
  3. Implement minimal code
  4. Run test — verify pass
  5. Commit (Git Write Policy applies)
- **Commands** with expected output where applicable

## No placeholders

These are plan failures — never write them:

- TBD, TODO, "implement later", "fill in details"
- "Add appropriate error handling" / "add validation" / "handle edge cases" without specifics
- "Write tests for the above" without actual test code
- "Similar to Task N" (repeat the code — tasks may be read out of order)
- Steps that describe what to do without showing how (code blocks required for code steps)

## Path verification checklist

**Run after plan draft, before user confirmation.** Block plan approval on unresolved paths.

1. **Extract paths** from every `**Files:**` line and inline backticks that look like repo paths. Exclude `conductor/` Conductor artifacts.
2. **Verify each path** using read-only shell:
   - `test -f <path>` or `test -d <path>`
   - Glob for `*_test.go` / naming variants when exact path missing
   - For line references (`file.go:613`), `Read` the file and confirm symbol or line exists
3. **Record verified paths** in a plan body **Path verification** subsection:

   ```markdown
   ## Path verification
   > **Path note:** `LoadSuite` lives in `pkg/suite/suite.go` (type at ~613). There is no `pkg/suite/load.go`.
   ```

4. **Fix table:** If any path fails verification, present a table to the user before `Confirm Plan`:

   | Plan reference | Status | Correct path |
   | -------------- | ------ | -------------- |
   | `pkg/suite/load.go` | Missing | `pkg/suite/suite.go` |

5. **Halt** on unresolved paths — do not proceed to user approval until fixed or user explicitly accepts a documented alternative.

## Plan self-review

After drafting the complete plan, run this checklist and fix inline:

1. **Spec coverage:** Each spec requirement maps to at least one todo.
2. **Placeholder scan:** No banned patterns above.
3. **Type consistency:** Signatures and names match across tasks.
4. **Sync bookends:** `conductor-sync-in-progress` is first; `conductor-sync-complete` is last.
5. **Phase todos:** Manual verification todos exist for each phase when the workflow defines phase checkpointing.
6. **Path verification:** All repo paths verified per checklist above; Path verification subsection present.
7. **Prerequisites:** Vacuous-test risks have PREREQUISITE todos with evidence.
8. **Test constraints:** No unbounded sleeps or undeclared network dependencies.
9. **Namespace:** Single owner for shared ID registries when programme spans tracks.

## Direct plan execution

Users may run this plan from Cursor chat without `/conductor-implement`. Sync bookend todos keep `tracks.md` and `metadata.json` aligned with progress. Implementation todos follow `conductor/context/workflow.md` including TDD and Systematic Debugging Protocol.
