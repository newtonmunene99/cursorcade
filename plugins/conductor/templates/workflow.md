# Project Workflow

## Guiding Principles

1. **The Plan is the Source of Truth:** All work must be tracked in the Cursor plan file (`.cursor/plans/*.plan.md` frontmatter `todos`)
2. **The Tech Stack is Deliberate:** Changes to the tech stack must be documented in `.cursor/context/tech-stack.md` *before* implementation
3. **Test-Driven Development:** Write unit tests before implementing functionality
4. **High Code Coverage:** Aim for >80% code coverage for all modules
5. **User Experience First:** Every decision should prioritize user experience
6. **Non-Interactive & CI-Aware:** Prefer non-interactive commands. Use `CI=true` for watch-mode tools (tests, linters) to ensure single execution.

## Task Workflow

All tasks follow a strict lifecycle. **All Git write operations** (staging, commits, notes, etc.) MUST follow the **Git Write Policy** in the Conductor rule.

### Standard Task Workflow

1. **Select Task:** Choose the next available todo from the Cursor plan file (`.cursor/plans/*.plan.md`) in sequential order

2. **Mark In Progress:** Before beginning work, update the plan frontmatter: set the todo's `status` to `in_progress`

### TDD Iron Law

**No production code without a failing test first.** If implementation code was written before tests, delete it and start over from the failing test.

| Excuse | Reality |
| ------ | ------- |
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks; a test takes seconds. |
| "I'll test after" | Tests that pass immediately prove nothing. |
| "Keep as reference" | Adapting pre-written code is testing after. Delete and rewrite. |

**Mandatory verify-red:** Run the test and confirm it fails for the *expected reason* (missing feature, not a typo). Do not proceed until red is verified.

**Mandatory verify-green:** Run the test and confirm pass with pristine output (no errors or warnings) before commit.

**Minimal implementation:** Write only enough code to pass the test. No extra features (YAGNI).

3. **Write Failing Tests (Red Phase):**
   - Create a new test file for the feature or bug fix.
   - Write one or more unit tests that clearly define the expected behavior and acceptance criteria for the task.
   - **CRITICAL:** Run the tests and confirm that they fail as expected. This is the "Red" phase of TDD. Do not proceed until you have failing tests.

4. **Implement to Pass Tests (Green Phase):**
   - Write the minimum amount of application code necessary to make the failing tests pass.
   - Run the test suite again and confirm that all tests now pass. This is the "Green" phase.

5. **Refactor (Optional but Recommended):**
   - With the safety of passing tests, refactor the implementation code and the test code to improve clarity, remove duplication, and enhance performance without changing the external behavior.
   - Rerun tests to ensure they still pass after refactoring.

6. **Verify Coverage:** Run coverage reports using the project's chosen tools. For example, in a Python project, this might look like:
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
   ```
   Target: >80% coverage for new code. The specific tools and commands will vary by language and framework.

7. **Document Deviations:** If implementation differs from tech stack:
   - **STOP** implementation
   - Update `.cursor/context/tech-stack.md` with new design
   - Add dated note explaining the change
   - Resume implementation

8. **Commit Code Changes:**
   - Propose a clear, concise commit message e.g., `feat(ui): Create basic HTML structure for calculator`.
   - Follow the **Git Write Policy** in the Conductor rule before staging and committing. Suggested commands: `git add <files>` then `git commit -m "<message>"`.

9. **Attach Task Summary with Git Notes:**
   - **Step 9.1: Get Commit Hash:** Obtain the hash of the *just-completed commit* (`git log -1 --format="%H"`). Skip if no commit was made.
   - **Step 9.2: Draft Note Content:** Create a detailed summary for the completed task. This should include the task name, a summary of changes, a list of all created/modified files, and the core "why" for the change.
   - **Step 9.3: Attach Note:** Follow the **Git Write Policy** in the Conductor rule before running:
     ```bash
     git notes add -m "<note content>" <commit_hash>
     ```

10. **Get and Record Task Commit SHA:**
    - **Step 10.1: Update Plan:** Read the Cursor plan file, find the completed todo, set `status` to `completed`, and append the first 7 characters of the commit hash to `content` (if a commit was made; otherwise omit the SHA).
    - **Step 10.2: Write Plan:** Write the updated content back to the plan file.

11. **Commit Plan Update:**
    - **Action:** Follow the **Git Write Policy** in the Conductor rule before staging and committing the modified plan file. Suggested message: `conductor(plan): Mark task 'Create user model' as complete`.

### Systematic Debugging Protocol

**Iron law:** No fixes without root-cause investigation first.

Use this protocol when tests fail, behavior is unexpected, or a fix attempt did not work. Do not guess.

**Phase 1 — Root cause:** Read error messages and stack traces fully. Reproduce consistently. Check recent changes (`git diff`, recent commits). Trace data flow to find where behavior diverges.

**Phase 2 — Pattern analysis:** Find similar working code in the repo. Compare differences between working and broken paths.

**Phase 3 — Hypothesis:** State one clear theory. Test it with the smallest possible change. One variable at a time.

**Phase 4 — Implementation:** Write a failing test that reproduces the bug (see **TDD Iron Law** above). Apply a single fix for the root cause. Verify tests pass.

**Escalation:** After **3 failed fix attempts**, stop and call `AskQuestion` to question the approach or architecture with the user. Do not attempt a fourth fix without discussion.

### Phase Completion Verification and Checkpointing Protocol

**Trigger:** This protocol is executed immediately after a task is completed that also concludes a phase in the Cursor plan file.

1.  **Announce Protocol Start:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and the verification and checkpointing protocol has begun.

2.  **Ensure Test Coverage for Phase Changes:**
    -   **Step 2.1: Determine Phase Scope:** To identify the files changed in this phase, you must first find the starting point. Read the Cursor plan file to find the Git commit SHA of the *previous* phase's checkpoint. If no previous checkpoint exists, the scope is all changes since the first commit.
    -   **Step 2.2: List Changed Files:** Execute `git diff --name-only <previous_checkpoint_sha> HEAD` to get a precise list of all files modified during this phase.
    -   **Step 2.3: Verify and Create Tests:** For each file in the list:
        -   **CRITICAL:** First, check its extension. Exclude non-code files (e.g., `.json`, `.md`, `.yaml`).
        -   For each remaining code file, verify a corresponding test file exists.
        -   If a test file is missing, you **must** create one. Before writing the test, **first, analyze other test files in the repository to determine the correct naming convention and testing style.** The new tests **must** validate the functionality described in this phase's todos in the Cursor plan file.

3.  **Execute Automated Tests with Proactive Debugging:**
    -   Before execution, you **must** announce the exact shell command you will use to run the tests.
    -   **Example Announcement:** "I will now run the automated test suite to verify the phase. **Command:** `CI=true npm test`"
    -   Execute the announced command.
    -   If tests fail, follow the **Systematic Debugging Protocol** above. Use `AskQuestion` for final escalation if debugging stalls after 3 fix attempts.

4.  **Propose a Detailed, Actionable Manual Verification Plan:**
    -   **CRITICAL:** To generate the plan, first analyze `.cursor/context/product.md`, `.cursor/context/product-guidelines.md`, and the Cursor plan file to determine the user-facing goals of the completed phase.
    -   You **must** generate a step-by-step plan that walks the user through the verification process, including any necessary commands and specific, expected outcomes.
    -   The plan you present to the user **must** follow this format:

        **For a Frontend Change:**
        ```
        The automated tests have passed. For manual verification, please follow these steps:

        **Manual Verification Steps:**
        1.  **Start the development server with the command:** `npm run dev`
        2.  **Open your browser to:** `http://localhost:3000`
        3.  **Confirm that you see:** The new user profile page, with the user's name and email displayed correctly.
        ```

        **For a Backend Change:**
        ```
        The automated tests have passed. For manual verification, please follow these steps:

        **Manual Verification Steps:**
        1.  **Ensure the server is running.**
        2.  **Execute the following command in your terminal:** `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users -d '{"name": "test"}'`
        3.  **Confirm that you receive:** A JSON response with a status of `201 Created`.
        ```

5.  **Await Explicit User Feedback:**
    -   After presenting the detailed plan, ask the user for confirmation: "**Does this meet your expectations? Please confirm with yes or provide feedback on what needs to be changed.**"
    -   **PAUSE** and await the user's response. Do not proceed without an explicit yes or confirmation.

6.  **Create Checkpoint Commit:**
    -   Follow the **Git Write Policy** in the Conductor rule before staging and committing. Suggested message: `conductor(checkpoint): Checkpoint end of Phase X`. Skip if the user declines and no commit is needed.

7.  **Attach Auditable Verification Report using Git Notes:**
    -   **Step 7.1: Draft Note Content:** Create a detailed verification report including the automated test command, the manual verification steps, and the user's confirmation.
    -   **Step 7.2: Attach Note:** Follow the **Git Write Policy** in the Conductor rule before running `git notes add` on the checkpoint commit.

8.  **Get and Record Phase Checkpoint SHA:**
    -   **Step 8.1: Get Commit Hash:** Obtain the hash of the *just-created checkpoint commit* (`git log -1 --format="%H"`). Skip if no checkpoint commit was made.
    -   **Step 8.2: Update Plan:** Read the Cursor plan file, find the heading for the completed phase in the markdown body, and append the first 7 characters of the commit hash in the format `[checkpoint: <sha>]` (if available).
    -   **Step 8.3: Write Plan:** Write the updated content back to the plan file.

9. **Commit Plan Update:**
    - **Action:** Follow the **Git Write Policy** in the Conductor rule before staging and committing the modified plan file. Suggested message: `conductor(plan): Mark phase '<PHASE NAME>' as complete`.

10.  **Announce Completion:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and the checkpoint has been created, with the detailed verification report attached as a git note.
